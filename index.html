            What the devil. The only thing worse than yellow snow is green snow. When things happen - enjoy them. They're little gifts. Now we don't want him to get lonely, so we'll give him a little friend.

            All kinds of happy little splashes. You create the dream - then you bring it into your world. Nice little fluffy clouds laying around in the sky being lazy.
            
            Any little thing can be your friend if you let it be. Life is too short to be alone, too precious. Share it with a friend. Maybe we got a few little happy bushes here, just covered with snow. It's so important to do something every day that will make you happy.
            
            Anytime you learn something your time and energy are not wasted. You have to make these big decisions. Use your imagination, let it go. All you need is a dream in your heart, and an almighty knife. We don't make mistakes we just have happy little accidents.

<p>If you didn't have baby clouds, you wouldn't have big clouds. We touch the canvas, the canvas takes what it wants. Be so very light. Be a gentle whisper. Let's give him a friend too. Everybody needs a friend. Just take out whatever you don't want. It'll change your entire perspective.
